# Node.js Version Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Node.js Engine Requirements
- **Main project** (`package.json`): Updated from no requirement to `>=22.0.0`
- **Worker project** (`worker/package.json`): Updated from `>=18` to `>=22.0.0`

### 2. Updated GitHub Actions Workflows
- **Frontend deployment** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`): Updated from Node.js 18 to 22
- **Worker deployment** (`.github/workflows/deploy-worker.yml`): Updated from Node.js 20 to 22
- Removed hardcoded Wrangler version to use latest available

### 3. Added Development Configuration
- Created `.nvmrc` file with Node.js version 22 for local development consistency

## Benefits

### Security & Performance
- Latest Node.js LTS provides improved security patches
- Better performance and memory management
- Enhanced ES module support

### Wrangler Compatibility
- Meets latest Wrangler 4.x requirements
- Better TypeScript support and faster builds
- Improved development experience

### Future-Proofing
- Ensures compatibility with latest npm packages
- Prepares project for upcoming Node.js features
- Aligns with modern JavaScript ecosystem standards

## Verification

Your current Node.js version (v24.7.0) already meets the new requirements. The project will now:

1. Enforce minimum Node.js 22 in package.json engines
2. Use Node.js 22 in all CI/CD pipelines
3. Provide consistent development environment via .nvmrc

## Next Steps

1. Team members should update to Node.js 22+ locally
2. Consider updating outdated dependencies when convenient:
   - ESLint to v9 (breaking changes may require config updates)
   - Vite to v7 (check for breaking changes)
   - Vitest to v4 (verify test compatibility)

## Security Compliance

This update aligns with the security guidelines by:
- Using the latest stable Node.js version with security patches
- Ensuring consistent environments across development and production
- Maintaining compatibility with latest security tools and practices
